title: "CoSSAT: Code-Switched Speech Annotation Tool"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-11-03-COSSAT
excerpt: 'Code-switching refers to the alternation of two or more languages in a conversation or utterance and is common in multilingual communities across the world. Building codeswitched speech and natural language processing systems are challenging due to the lack of annotated speech and text data. We present a speech annotation interface CoS-SAT, which helps annotators transcribe codeswitched speech faster, more easily and more accurately than a traditional interface, by displaying candidate words from monolingual speech recognizers. We conduct a user study on the transcription of Hindi-English codeswitched speech with 10 annotators and describe quantitative and qualitative results.'
